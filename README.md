 Basic Social Network Analysis Tool
Overview
A simple tool implemented in Python to analyze social networks by calculating and visualizing centrality measures.

Features
Graph Representation: Create a directed graph with nodes and edges.
Centrality Calculations:
In-Degree Centrality: Measures the number of edges pointing to a node.
Out-Degree Centrality: Measures the number of edges originating from a node.
Total Degree Centrality: Measures the total number of edges connected to a node in an undirected graph.
How It Works
Create a directed graph with nodes and edges.
Calculate in-degree and out-degree centrality.
Convert to an undirected graph and calculate total degree centrality.
Print the centrality measures for each node.
